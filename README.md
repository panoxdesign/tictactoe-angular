# Tictactoe

This Project was made with Angular.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the Angular Language as simple as possible. To implement a simple game like Tic Tac Toe is one way of doing this, instead of creating big masks. Maybe not everything is perfect at the moment, but it is simple enough to extend and to improve anytime. So it's a perfect starting point to test things and to improve your skills.
