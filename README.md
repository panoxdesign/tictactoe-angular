# Tictactoe

This Project was made with Angular.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the language Angular as simple as possible. To implement a simple game like Tic Tac Toe is one simple way, instead of creating big masks. Maybe not everything in this project is perfect and good practice at the moment, but it is simple to extend and to improve anytime. So it is a perfect Project to test things and to improve yourself.
